# Deep_Drowsiness_Detection
Implementation is for people who feel drowsy when driving which can lead to accidents.

YOLO one of the most popular model architectures and object detection algorithms we will try to implement it in a more productive mannerism.

Things to Keep in Mind:
1) Install ultralytics YOLOv5
2) Detect Objects from Images
3) Detect Objects from Pre-Recorded Videos
4) Detect Objects in Real Time Using OpenCV
5) Fine Tuning a Drowsiness Model using YOLOv5 PyTorch
6) Perform Real Time Drowsiness Detection.
