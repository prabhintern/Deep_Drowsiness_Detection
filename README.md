# Deep_Drowsiness_Detection
Implementation is for people who feel drowsy when driving which can lead to accidents.

-->You Only Look Once (YOLO) ?
-->You Only Look Once (YOLO) is one of the most popular model architectures and object detection algorithms. It uses one of the best neural network architectures to produce high accuracy and overall processing 
   speed, which is the main reason for its popularity. If we search Google for object detection algorithms, the first result will be related to the YOLO model.

-->What is PyTorch ?
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. Torch is an open source ML library used for creating deep neural networks and is written in the Lua scripting language. It's one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research. The framework is built to speed up the process between research prototyping and deployment.
